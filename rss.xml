            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>un/prepared</h1><p>We are not ready. But we never have been; in fact, you could say that while we are not ready, we also cannot wait. We were not ready for the industrial age, nor for the information age; we were not ready for the collapse of enormous empires, nor the emergence of nations. And yet, for the most part, we cannot imagine going back. Human beings persevere, and evolve, too.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/2f435fda4c5e475b9eb53bd06421b52e/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=4001&cropwidth=6000&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ff8a8d9f5-d6bb-421e-81b8-a05494df34a3.jpg&x=0&y=0"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>'Light field' camera maker Lytro announces professional VR video rig</h1><p>Camera maker Lytro drew our attention three years ago with what it called "light field" photography.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How A Man's Fitbit Got Him The Medical Care He Needed</h1><p>On Jan. 5, a man checked into a hospital's emergency room in Camden, New Jersey. Because his heart was beating irregularly, doctors suspected he had atrial fibrillation, the most common type of arrhythmia, which can increase the risk of stroke.
