  We are not ready. But we never have been; in fact, you could say that while we

  imagine going back. Human beings persevere, and evolve, too.

# un/prepared

**We are not ready. But we never have been; in fact, you could say that while we are not ready, we also cannot wait. We were not ready for the industrial age, nor for the information age; we were not ready for the collapse of enormous empires, nor the emergence of nations. And yet, for the most part, we cannot imagine going back. Human beings persevere, and evolve, too.**

**But it is the exponential acceleration which we are in the middle of which is perhaps the hardest for us to imagine: a world where humans and our technology collide in ways which make the piercing of skin and the passing-through of our bodies not the traumatic, rare experiences of accidents and hospitals, but the path to 'upgrades,' a time where almost all information is available almost all the time. In this coming cyborg age, and the time which might supersede it, a posthuman age of the so-called 'singularity,' we have many of the same tensions of today to contend with. Like technologies before them, these cyborgian technologies have the ability to erase class difference and lessen suffering for almost everyone. But human beings have perhaps always had the ability to diminish the 'power-over' states which cause suffering amongst us. As we have become increasingly divorced from the impacts of our negative actions through globalization (or the source of them, if you are on the other side of a divide of privilege of haves and have-nots,) it is sometimes hard to see the shadow of our technologies. Unconfronted by the small injustices of long workdays and cramped quarters or the horrors of modern-day slavery and ecological destruction, the call to act in service of our fellow humans might sometimes be missing.**

**This new technological layer, however, has done something which previous technological accelerations perhaps have not: as capitalism has invited every business to be digital and the race to the lowest possible cost for information technology has also resulted in lower and lower barriers to entry into the technological revolution, the raw tools to become rich (or connected, safe and privileged) are in some senses available to all but the poorest, as well. For all the talk of 'tech company bubbles' and 'startup fads,' there is some truth to the claims of the 'disruptive' startup: the blip of a company that was Google has unseated vast monuments to the industrial age in a matter of just a few short years. And the startups which have built upon its platforms (or been purchased by it) have also been chipping away steadily at the base of the castle walls of the rich's claims to entitlement even if enriching them in the short term. Startups needn't even be companies--they can be the Occupy movement, Anonymous or any number of rising tribes of self-educated and self-organizing people, like the Citizen Science movement or guilds of video gamers. Riches in the coming age will not be measured in things alone (though food, water, energy and other basic resources will likely remain contested for the near future) but in information, access and ingenuity. The age of the cyborg will be built upon the rising tide of the information age, and the keys to the kingdom will be cloned over and over until they are no longer relevant.**
