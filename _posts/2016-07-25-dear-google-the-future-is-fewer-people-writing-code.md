      A message from Josh Tyrangiel -Josh Tyrangiel You are an educated,
      successful person capable of abstract thought. A VP doing an SVP's job.
      Your office, appointed with decent furniture and a healthy amount of
      natural light filtered through vertical blinds, is commensurate with
      nearly two decades of service to the craft of management.

  Google recently launched Project Bloks - a "platform" that will enable
  developers, educators and designers to work together in order to build
  "physical programming experiences" for children. This actually has the
  potential to be a great educational tool - but not in the way Google presents
  it (or at least not in the way it's being written about).
