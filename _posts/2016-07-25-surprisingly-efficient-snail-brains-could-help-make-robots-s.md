  Searching for (and consuming food) is a surprisingly complex goal-directed
  behavior, essential for survival. It appears snails are particularly efficient
  at processing these decisions. According to Kemenes, the study was also able
  to show "how this system helps to manage how much energy they use once they
  have made a decision."
